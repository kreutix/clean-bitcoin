# #CleanBitcoin MasterPlan v0.2

- Find supportive followers (around 1000 should be enough to get something going)
- Create a collaboration space (perhaps a [#Slack](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Slack) channel)
- Brainstorm solutions on slack and twitter
- Kickstart a [#CleanBitcoin](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CleanBitcoin) campaign to get lots of people on this path to eventually change bitcoin ‚ù§Ô∏è üöÄ

## Problem and possible solutions

I believe Bitcoin will be the reserve currency for all crypto currencies. Bitcoin is not clean at the moment, because it needs a lot of energy for the necessary PoW mining process. 

I see two solutions at the moment:

- Only mine with [#CleanEnergy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CleanEnergy)
- Use a different algorithm

## Tasks

### Find supportive followers

Please follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/KreutiX and retweet this MasterPlan :)

### Create a collaboration space

I will start this when I have around 300 followers

### Brainstorm solutions on slack and twitter

Always feel free to tweet me some thoughts or create an issue here on GitHub to discuss :)

### Kickstart a #CleanBitcoin campagin

When the time is right we will do this together! ‚ù§Ô∏è
